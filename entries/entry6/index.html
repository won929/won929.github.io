    "I believe that it's often more painful when you trip while running fast originally.

    Even if I resolve to pay attention to the obstacles and run, I could still stumble over a hidden root or falter due to a lack of stamina.
    
    There are still countless times when you might stumble, but each time, I've decided to lend a helping hand.
    
    Of course, holding your hand and getting up are your responsibilities, but I will continue to silently offer my hand by your side.
    
    Because that's the only thing I can do for you."
