    "The reason I liked you was because you seemed perfect,
    But in reality, you had many flaws that I didn't initially see.
    However, I love even those imperfections.
    I liked you because you were perfect, but I love you because you're not.
    I, who always avoided, loved you who knew how to confront.
    I, who ran away from mistakes, loved you who knew how to admit them.
    I, who lived passively, loved your passion for what you do.
    Even now, I love the way you are."
