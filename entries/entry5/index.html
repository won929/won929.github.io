    "I fell while running and got hurt, but I just brushed it off and got up, so I couldn't understand the child who hesitated and cried. I didn't get how my mom, shivering in the cold during the winter, felt because I rarely felt cold.
    
    I didn't understand my friend who expected empathy from me, even though I never talked about my own struggles.
    
    I didn't understand myself.
    
    Understanding was something too difficult for me, almost like a young child learning to walk."
